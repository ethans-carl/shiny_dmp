# shiny_dmp

This is a set of notes and accompanying shiny application for teaching a simple, two-sided labor search and matching model.  I originally created it for teaching ECON 331, Intermediate Macroeconomics, at Carleton College.  It's based on the treatment in the first part of chapter 1 of Christopher Pissarides _Equilibrium Unemployment Theory_.
