# shiny_dmp

This is a set of notes and accompanying shiny application for teaching a simple, two-sided labor search and matching model.  I originally created it for teaching ECON 331, Intermediate Macroeconomics, at Carleton College.  It's based on the treatment in the first part of chapter 1 of Christopher Pissarides _Equilibrium Unemployment Theory_.

The application is relatively simple; it takes slider inputs for different parameters and calculates the steady state wage, market tightness, unemployment, and level of vacancies.  The idea is that instructors can use it to quicky illustrate comparative statics and/or students can use it to develop and verify intuition about the predictions of the model.
